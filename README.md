# addplayersMC
a mod to enable NPC (Alex and Steve) on minecraft 1.17

you will say that Alex (or Alexandra, in full name) and Steve are not real players.
# no, you are wrong
# inside the Minecraft JAR file we can find some Textures called respectively "alex.png" and "steve.png"

# unfortunately in the minecraft entitylist there are NO entities called "Alex" or "Steve"

# this mod inserts two simple strings into the Minecraft code to introduce two entities called "alex" and "steve" respectively
Note: I can't put a demo on spawning because github is infamous and for size reasons it won't let me load them ðŸ˜¢
