# why this mod isn't updated to 1.19.0 ??

ok, now I'll explain everything...
the mod if you look carefully in the source files was created on MCreator which is a "minecraft mod toolkit" and then continued with jetbrains intellij idea community. 

# so now theoretically the mod is independent, right ?

NOPE, the mod as mentioned before was created with MCreator, ****and then continued with intellij idea****, which means that the mod is still based on the mcreator toolkit

# ok, good story, but what does it have to do with the update to 1.19.0?

ok, just look this image...

do you understand now?

as long as MCreator doesn't update the programming api to 1.19.0 

**I literally can't do anything**



# conclusion

AddplayersMc is still supported (to learn more go here --> [Security](https://github.com/star08-web/addplayersMC/blob/main/SECURITY.md) )

but, until MCreator is updated to 1.19.0 I will not be able to do anything, sorry

 there is also good news though, version 2.0.2 is coming and will have support for 1.18.0 check on [PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/add-players/) or on this repo to find out more
